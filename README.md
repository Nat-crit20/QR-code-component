## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

When I was started this I found that writing the html was the easiest part. What I struggled most was with the css. I had to constantly play with the sizing to get it perfect and even then I still don't entirely understand what it is that I did to make the style come out the way I wanted it to.

### Continued development

From this I learned that I need to review more into responsive sizing, maybe look more into grids.
